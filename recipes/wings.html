        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Wings</li>
            <li>Buffalo Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to its highest temperature, ideally around 500°F (260°C), to mimic the high heat of a pizza oven. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Roll out your pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into a large, thin circle or oval, about 12–14 inches wide. The dough should be thin in the center with a slightly thicker edge to create the signature New York-style crust.</li>

            <li><strong>Transfer the Dough:</strong> Place the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>

            <li><strong>Add the Sauce:</strong> Spread a thin, even layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving about 1 inch around the edges for the crust.</li>

            <li><strong>Add the Cheese:</strong> Sprinkle an even layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the surface but avoiding the edges. Use as much cheese as you like for that classic stretchy, cheesy topping.</li>

            <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or directly onto the oven rack (using parchment paper for easy handling). Bake for 8–12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and lightly golden, and the crust is crisp and slightly charred on the edges.</li>

            <li><strong>Cool and Slice:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into large, foldable wedges and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
