        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Wings</li>
            <li>Buffalo Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). If using an air fryer, preheat it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken Wings:</strong> Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to help them crisp up during cooking. Place them in a large bowl.</li>

            <li><strong>Arrange on a Baking Sheet:</strong> Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup. Place a wire rack on top to allow the wings to cook evenly. Arrange the wings in a single layer on the rack, ensuring they aren’t overcrowded.</li>

            <li><strong>Bake the Wings:</strong> Bake the wings for 40–50 minutes, flipping them halfway through to ensure even cooking. If using an air fryer, cook the wings at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Buffalo Sauce:</strong> While the wings are cooking, warm the buffalo sauce in a small saucepan over low heat or in the microwave. Stir occasionally to ensure it's smooth and ready to coat the wings.</li>

            <li><strong>Toss the Wings in Sauce:</strong> Once the wings are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oven or air fryer. Transfer the wings to a large bowl and pour the buffalo sauce over them. Toss until the wings are evenly coated.</li>

            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the buffalo wings hot with celery sticks, carrot sticks, and ranch or blue cheese dressing on the side for dipping.</li>
